# Successful Approaches to Homelessness and Addiction in North America

## Introduction

Homelessness and addiction are complex societal challenges requiring multi-faceted solutions. Across North America, various communities have implemented innovative approaches with measurable success. This document examines effective strategies from cities and towns of different sizes, highlighting what has worked and why.

## Large Cities

### Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada

**Population:** ~63,000

**Achievement:** First city in North America to effectively end chronic homelessness

**Key Strategies:**
- Implementation of a Housing First model beginning in 2009
- Commitment to house anyone experiencing homelessness within 10 days
- Comprehensive support services post-housing
- Strong coordination between government agencies, nonprofits, and community organizations

**Results:** By 2015, Medicine Hat announced it had effectively ended chronic homelessness, with anyone identified as homeless receiving housing within 10 days. The city maintains a functional zero approach, meaning homelessness is rare, brief, and non-recurring.

### Houston, Texas, USA

**Population:** 2.3 million

**Achievement:** Reduced homelessness by 63% between 2011 and 2023

**Key Strategies:**
- Coordinated city-wide system integrating over 100 organizations
- The Way Home initiative - a collaborative, housing-focused approach
- Permanent supportive housing prioritizing chronically homeless individuals
- Rapid re-housing for those experiencing situational homelessness
- Streamlined housing placement process

**Results:** Houston housed over 25,000 people between 2012 and 2022, significantly reducing street homelessness despite population growth, economic challenges, and natural disasters.

## Mid-Sized Cities

### Burlington, Vermont, USA

**Population:** ~44,000

**Achievement:** Pioneered low-barrier shelter and housing retention programs

**Key Strategies:**
- Permanent supportive housing with embedded mental health services

- Housing retention teams providing intensive case management
- Coordinated entry system across Chittenden County
- Harm reduction approach to addiction

**Results:** The Chittenden County Homeless Alliance reported a 45% decrease in chronic homelessness between 2018 and 2020, even amid the pandemic.

### Providence, Rhode Island, USA

**Population:** ~180,000

**Achievement:** Innovative addiction treatment integration with housing

**Key Strategies:**
- Rhode Island's AnchorED program - peer recovery specialists in emergency departments
- Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) directly connected to housing programs
- Housing stabilization services funded through Medicaid
- Safe stations program allowing fire stations to serve as entry points to treatment

**Results:** 83% reduction in opioid overdose deaths among program participants between 2016 and 2019, with substantially higher housing retention rates for homeless individuals with substance use disorders.

## Small Towns

### Rockford, Illinois, USA

**Population:** ~147,000

**Achievement:** First city in the US to reach functional zero for veteran and chronic homelessness

**Key Strategies:**
- Built By-Name Lists tracking every homeless person
- Weekly case conferencing with all service providers
- Restructured federal and state funding priorities
- Strong data-driven approach to resource allocation

**Results:** Reached functional zero for veteran homelessness in 2015 and for chronic homelessness in 2017, maintaining these achievements through present day.

### Chatham-Kent, Ontario, Canada

**Population:** ~105,000

**Achievement:** Rapid implementation of coordinated homelessness prevention

**Key Strategies:**
- Homelessness Prevention Team with 24/7 response capability
- Prevention-focused rent supplements
- Mobile addiction services reaching rural areas
- Indigenous-led programming for First Nations members
- Flexible funding model allowing customized interventions

**Results:** 93% success rate in preventing homelessness for at-risk households between 2018-2022, with particularly strong outcomes for addiction-involved clients.

## Rural Approaches

### Northern New Mexico Collaborative, USA

**Population:** Multiple rural communities across Rio Arriba and Taos Counties

**Achievement:** Culturally responsive substance use and homelessness intervention

**Key Strategies:**
- La Luz Program integrating traditional healing practices with clinical treatment
- Mobile medical units delivering addiction services to remote areas
- Community health workers (promotoras) from local communities
- Permanent supportive housing specifically designed for rural contexts
- Cross-county coordination of limited resources

**Results:** 68% reduction in overdose deaths from 2016-2021 in participating communities, with housing retention rates exceeding 80% for formerly homeless individuals with substance use disorders.

## Common Success Factors

Several elements appear consistently across communities that have made significant progress:

1. **Housing First Approach:** Providing stable housing without preconditions, then addressing other issues.

2. **Cross-Sector Collaboration:** Breaking down silos between healthcare, housing, addiction services, mental health, and law enforcement.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Using robust tracking systems to ensure no one falls through the cracks.

4. **Harm Reduction Philosophy:** Meeting people "where they are" rather than requiring abstinence for services.

5. **Long-Term Support:** Continuing case management and services well after housing placement.

6. **Flexible Funding Models:** Allowing for customized interventions based on individual needs.

7. **Community Engagement:** Involving businesses, faith communities, and residents in solutions.

## Innovative Emerging Models

### Tiny Home Communities

Cities like Seattle (Washington), Austin (Texas), and Kitchener (Ontario) have developed tiny home villages specifically for homeless individuals with substance use disorders. These communities offer privacy, dignity, and community support while providing on-site addiction services.

### Medicaid Innovation Waivers

States including California, Oregon, and Massachusetts have used Medicaid innovation waivers to fund housing-related services for individuals with substance use disorders, effectively treating housing as healthcare.

### Public Health Emergency Responses

British Columbia's declaration of a public health emergency for overdose deaths in 2016 enabled rapid policy changes, including prescription safer supply programs that have shown promise in stabilizing housing for people with severe addiction.

## Conclusion

The most successful approaches to addressing homelessness and addiction share key characteristics: they are comprehensive, collaborative, and treat both issues as interconnected public health challenges rather than moral or criminal issues. Communities that have made the most progress recognize that stable housing is a foundation for addressing addiction, while addiction services must be accessible regardless of housing status.

The evidence across North America consistently demonstrates that investments in evidence-based approaches like Housing First, harm reduction, and integrated service delivery not only save lives but are ultimately more cost-effective than managing these issues through emergency services, hospitalization, and incarceration.
